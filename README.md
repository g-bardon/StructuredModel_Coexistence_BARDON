## Codes used for analyses in "Structured models of competition to understand the coexistence of species" manuscript
All codes have been written in R by GaÃ«l Bardon.

The "New_analysis_article" folder contains codes to perform the analysis presented in the article.
- Invasion_analysis folder contains the scripts that allowed us to choose the parameter sets (section 2.2) and to perform the invasion analysis computations (section 3.1)
- Invasion_analysis folder corresponds to the supplement A (invasion analysis with the M&B's model structure)
- sensitivity_analysis folder contains the functions to compute the sensitivity (section 2.4) and the associated results (section 3.2 ; Appendix C)
- community_simulations folder gathers the scripts and figures corresponding to the section 3.3 and appendix D
- community_simulations_MB folder gathers the scripts and figures corresponding to the supplement C
- 
The "old_analysis" folder corresponds to the codes used before september 2020. These codes were used to perform analysis described in "Rapport M2 Gael Bardon".
The codes in this folder correspond to:
- computation_R0_combined_model.R : Computation of invasion criteria in the combined model (section 2.4)
- conics_intersection_plot.R : Representation of the intersection of the conic sections (section 2.5)
- multispecies_community_simulation.R : Simulation of population dynamics in communities with large number of species. (section 4.3)
- Prelim_Num_Study_ComModels.R : Preliminary numerical study on combined model (section 2.2)
- SensiAna_CombMod_3Sets.R :Sensitivity analysis and representation on the combined model (section 3.3)
- SensiAna_CompetIntensity.R : Sensitivity analysis on parameter sets with different competition intensities (section 3.4)
- SensiAna_RarityEffect.R : Sensitivity analysis on parameter sets with different level of rarity for 1 species (section 3.5)
- sensitivity_analysis_function.R : functions to perform simulations of population dynamics, computation of invasion criteria and sensitivity analysis
- Simul_CompetIntensity.R : Simulations to check the effect of competition intensity on the sensitivity (section 3.4)
