## Codes used for analyses in "Structured models of competition to understand the coexistence of species" manuscript
 All codes have been written in R by GaÃ«l Bardon
The codes correspond to:
- computation_R0_combined_model.R : Computation of invasion criteria in the combined model
- conics_intersection_plot.R : Representation of the intersection of the conic sections representing the densities of species at coexistence equilibrium
- multispecies_community_simulation.R : Simulation of the population dynamics in communities with large number of species.
- Prelim_Num_Study_ComModels.R : Preliminary numerical study on combined model (computation of invasion criteria on simple models and comparison with simulation of population dynamics with the combined model)
- SensiAna_CombMod_3Sets.R : Computation and representation of the sensitivity of the combined model to parameters with Barabas' method. (3 sets of parameter)
- SensiAna_CompetIntensity.R : Sensitivity analysis on parameter sets with different ratios of intra/inter competition coefficients
- SensiAna_RarityEffect.R : Sensitivity analysis on parameter sets with different level of rarity for 1 species
- sensitivity_analysis_function.R : functions to perform simulation of population dynamics, computation of invasion criteria and sensitivity analysis
- Simul_CompetIntensity.R : Simulation to check the effect of competition intensity on the sensitivity
